# CAMPUSCONNECT 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: Inferno

### Team Members
- Member 1: Niharika Hareendran - TKM College Of Engineering
- Member 2: Sivanya T - TKM College Of Engineering
### Hosted Project Link
[mention your project hosted link here]

### Project Description
The CAMPUSCONNECT is a web-based application  used to manage and organise events efficiently.It alllows the admin to add the events and automatically sorts them based on date and time.Students can view upcoming events with countdown timer and expired events are removed automatically

### The Problem statement
Managing events manually can be difficult and time consuming. There is no proper system to solve events based on date and time,and students may miss important events. Therfore, a system is needed to automatically manage ,sort and display event with a countdown timer

### The Solution
The solution is to develop a web based system that automatically sorts events by date and time and display them with a countdown.This helps manage events efficiently and removes expired events automatically
